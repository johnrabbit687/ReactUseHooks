    description: A more configurable implemention of this hook that syncs changes across browser tabs and handles SSR. Provided much of the code and inspiration for this post.

This hook handles all the stateful logic required to add a <b>â˜¾ dark mode</b> toggle to your website. It utilizes localStorage to remember the user's chosen mode, defaults to their browser or OS level setting using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query and manages the setting of a `.dark-mode-enabled` className on `body` to apply your styles.
<br/><br/>
This post also helps illustrate the power of hook composition. The syncing of state to localStorage is handled by our [`useLocalStorage`](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage) hook. Detecting the user's dark mode preference is handled by our [`useMedia`](https://usehooks.com/useMedia) hook. Both of these hooks were created for other use-cases, but here we've composed them to create a super useful hook in relatively few lines of code. It's almost as if hooks bring the compositional power of React components to stateful logic! ðŸ¤¯
